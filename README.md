## 🌪️ Overview

Typhoon-Core transforms chaotic problem spaces into organized, optimal solutions using nature-inspired typhoon formation principles. Just as typhoons harness warm ocean energy, Typhoon-Core harnesses computational energy for cross-domain optimization.

### Quick Start

```python
from typhoon_core import TyphoonCore

# Solve complex problems with nature-inspired optimization
typhoon = TyphoonCore()
solution = typhoon.form_typhoon(problem_space)
